    <h1>100 Days of Code 2025 Log</h1>
    <h2>by Job Kroon</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my 100 Days of Code log! Here, I will document my journey as I learn Swift and work on various projects. Each entry will include the day number, date, and a brief description of what I learned or accomplished.</p>
    <p>Feel free to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jkroon.bsky.social">follow along on Bluesky</a> and check back for updates!</p>

            { day: 1, date:"16-04-2025", description: "Learning the basic syntax of Swift (operators, strings, characters and collection types). Setting up and styling this log file and a github repository." },
            { day: 2, date:"17-04-2025", description: "A deep dive in declarations, let and var and getting to know mutables NSMutableArray NSArray" },
            { day: 3, date:"18-04-2025", description: "Today I am traveling a full day, so getting in some #swift documentation and making notes. Also some learning in the Encode app. About if and switch statements to make conditionals, and use for-in, while, and repeat-while to make loops." },
            { day: 4, date:"21-04-2025", description: "A deep dive on Operators in a playground in Xcode. unary prefix, postix, binary infix and ternary operators. As an extra I had some git commands trouble so I figured that one out too." },
            { day: 5, date:"22-04-2025", description: "Deep dive in functions. Define and call functions, label their arguments, and use their return values. Like the documentation says. Tough day." },
            { day: 6, date:"23-04-2025", description: "All about Closures. Some documentation and practice in a Swift Playground. And I got hired today as a network engineer! Awesome day!" },
