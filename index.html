    <p>Welcome to my 100 Days of Code log! Here, I will document my journey as I learn Swift and work on various projects. Each entry will include the day number, date, and a brief description of what I learned or accomplished.</p>
    <p>Feel free to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jkroon.bsky.social">follow along on Bluesky</a> and check back for updates!</p>
